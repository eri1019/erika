Hello and good evening!

I give an explanation in each file using a comment in the code to avoid confusion. By the way, this is my first time creating a repository and storing codes on Github because I only used Devops and Azure Portal in my previous job, so I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly.

Whatever the outcome, I'm always grateful for the opportunity that you've given me.

Thank you, and God bless.
