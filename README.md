Hello, good evening!

I add an explanation in each file using a comment in the code to avoid confusion. By the way, this is my first time creating a repository and storing codes in Github because I only used Devops and Azure Portal in my previous job. The only thing we've used in Github before is the github copilot, which I failed to mention during the interview,so I'm not really sure if I'm doing it correctly.

Whatever the result, I'm always grateful for the opportunity that you've given me.

Thank you, and God bless.
